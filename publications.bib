  abstract = {We estimated the association between the level of restriction in nine different fields of activity and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in Spain, from 15 September 2020 to 9 May 2021.              A stringency index (0--1) was created for each Spanish province ( n=\,50) daily. A hierarchical multiplicative model was fitted. The median of coefficients across provinces (95\% bootstrap confidence intervals) quantified the effect of increasing one standard deviation in the stringency index over the logarithmic return of the weekly percentage variation of the 7-days SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, lagged 12\,days.                Overall, increasing restrictions reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 22\% (RR\,=\,0.78; one-sided 95\%CI: 0, 0.82) in 1 week, with highest effects for culture and leisure 14\% (0.86; 0, 0.98), social distancing 13\% (0.87; 0, 0.95), indoor restaurants 10\% (0.90; 0, 0.95) and indoor sports 6\% (0.94; 0, 0.98). In a reduced model with seven fields, culture and leisure no longer had a significant effect while ceremonies decreased transmission by 5\% (0.95; 0, 0.96).  Increased restrictions decreased COVID-19 transmission. Limitations include remaining collinearity between fields, and somewhat artificial quantification of qualitative restrictions, so the exact attribution of the effect to specific areas must be done with caution.},

  abstract = {Many recent studies have focused on the automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using deep learning (DL) methods. Most rely on existing complex DL methods, such as transfer learning or providing the models with carefully designed extracted features based on domain knowledge. A common assumption is that the deeper and more complex the DL model is, the better it learns. In this study, we propose two different DL models for automatic feature extraction from ECG signals for classification tasks: A CNN-LSTM hybrid model and an attention/transformer-based model with wavelet transform for the dimensional embedding. Both of the models extract the features from time series at the initial layers of the neural networks and can obtain performance at least equal to, if not greater than, many contemporary deep neural networks. To validate our hypothesis, we used three publicly available data-sets to evaluate the proposed models. Our model achieved a benchmark accuracy of 99.92\% for fall detection and 99.93\% for the PTB database for myocardial infarction versus normal heartbeat classification.},

  abstract = {Fall is a prominent issue due to its severe consequences both physically and mentally. Fall detection and prevention is a critical area of research because it can help elderly people to depend less on caregivers and allow them to live and move more independently. Using electrocardiograms (ECG) signals independently for fall detection and activity classification is a novel approach used in this paper. An algorithm has been proposed which uses pre-trained convolutional neural networks AlexNet and GoogLeNet as a classifier between the fall and no fall scenarios using electrocardiogram signals. The ECGs for both falling and no falling cases were obtained as part of the study using eight volunteers. The signals are pre-processed using an elliptical filter for signal noises such as baseline wander and power-line interface. As feature extractors, frequency-time representations (scalograms) were obtained by applying a continuous wavelet transform on the filtered ECG signals. These scalograms were used as inputs to the neural network and a significant validation accuracy of 98.08\% was achieved in the first model. The trained model is able to distinguish ECGs with a fall activity from an ECG with a no fall activity with an accuracy of 98.02\%. For the verification of the robustness of the proposed algorithm, our experimental dataset was augmented by adding two different publicly available datasets to it. The second model can classify fall, daily activities and no activities with an accuracy of 98.44\%. These models were developed by transfer learning from the domain of real images to the medical images. In comparison to traditional deep learning approaches, the transfer learning not only avoids ``reinventing the wheel,'' but also presents a lightweight solution to otherwise computationally heavy problems.},

In this even case, we introduce a method to construct the rational solutions based on cyclic dressing chains of Schr{\"o}dinger operators with potentials in the class of rational extensions of the harmonic oscillator. Each potential in the chain can be indexed by a single Maya diagram and expressed in terms of a Wronskian determinant whose entries are Hermite polynomials. We introduce the notion of cyclic Maya diagrams and characterize them for any possible period, using the concepts of genus and interlacing. The resulting classes of solutions can be expressed in terms of special polynomials that generalize the families of generalized Hermite, generalized Okamoto, and Umemura polynomials, showing that they are particular cases of a larger~family.},

This fact is exploited to derive a complete family of commuting integrals of motion of the model, thus establishing its integrability. The Dunkl operators are shown to possess a common flag of invariant finite-dimensional linear spaces of smooth scalar functions. This implies that the Hamiltonian of the model preserves a corresponding flag of smooth spin functions. The discrete spectrum of the restriction of the Hamiltonian to this spin flag is explicitly computed by triangularization. The integrability of the hyperbolic Sutherland spin chain of B N type associated with the dynamical model is proved using Polychronakos's ``freezing trick''.},

  abstract = {Exceptional orthogonal polynomials are families of orthogonal polynomials that arise as solutions of Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems. They generalize the classical families of Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials by allowing for polynomial sequences that miss a finite number of ''exceptional'' degrees. In this paper we introduce a new construction of multi-parameter exceptional Legendre polynomials by considering the isospectral deformation of the classical Legendre operator. Using confluent Darboux transformations and a technique from inverse scattering theory, we obtain a fully explicit description of the operators and polynomials in question. The main novelty of the paper is the novel construction that allows for exceptional polynomial families with an arbitrary number of real parameters.},

For a discrete set of values of the strength of the external potential, it is shown that a finite number of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the model can be exactly computed in an algebraic way.  It is well known that the class of exactly solvable problems does not include most physical problems. The development of computer science in the last decades has made possible the use of numerical methods to approximate exact solutions in a wide variety of situations. Yet, the study of exactly solvable models still deserves attention, not only because the knowledge of exact solutions can be used to test approximate methods, but also in its own right, due to the simplicity and mathematical beauty of the models, and the wide range of connections with other fields of physical and mathematical research. This is illustrated by the renewed interest in the Calogero-Sutherland (CS) models of interacting particles in one dimension, which have been recently applied to many different fields such us quantum spin chains with long range interaction [1], random matrix theory [2], fractional statistics and anyons [3], Yang-Mills theories [4], quantum Hall liquids [5], soliton theory [6], and black holes [7]. The first example of a non-trivial integrable quantum many-body problem was found by Calogero [8], and consists of a system of identical nonrelativistic particles interacting pairwise through an inverse-square potential v(r) = r -2 , so that the Hamiltonian is (1) H N = - N k=1 {$\partial$} 2 x k + g N j,k=1 j =k v(x j - x k).}

  abstract = {In this paper we derive structure theorems which characterize the spaces of linear and non-linear differential operators that preserve finite dimensional subspaces generated by polynomials in one or several variables. By means of the useful concept of deficiency, we can write an explicit basis for these spaces of differential operators. In the case of linear operators, these results apply to the theory of quasi-exact solvability in quantum mechanics, especially in the multivariate case where the Lie algebraic approach is harder to apply. In the case of non-linear operators, the structure theorems in this paper can be applied to the method of finding special solutions of non-linear evolution equations by nonlinear separation of variables. 1. Introduction. It is a fact that the Schr{\"o}dinger operators whose point spectrum , or at least part of it, can be computed algebraically are often related to differential operators admitting invariant spaces of polynomials. Lie algebras have played a unifying role in this area, because many of these polynomial spaces turn out to be irreducible modules for a faithful representation of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra by means of first-order differential operators. The classical theory of quasi-exactly solvable potentials has thus been built on the assumption that the exactly solvable Schr{\"o}dinger operator under study should be expressible as a quadratic element in the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of first-order differential operators, admitting an explicitly computable invariant sub-space of square-integrable functions, or a complete infinite flag thereof [1, 2, 3, 4].}

Exceptional Hermite polynomials satisfy a 2{$\ell$} + 3 recurrence relation where {$\ell$} is the length of the partition {$\lambda$}. Explicit expressions for such recurrence relations are given. {\copyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this paper we investigate which are the possible periods of the system for fixed N , and we show that there exist initial data that realize each of these possible periods.

We show that the regular zeros have two interlacing properties: one is the natural interlacing between zeros of consecutive polynomials as a consequence of their Sturm-Liouville character, while the other one shows interlacing between the zeros of exceptional and classical polynomials. A Heine-Mehler type formula is provided for the exceptional polynomials, which allows to derive the asymptotic behaviour of their regular zeros for large degree n and fixed codimension m. We also describe the location and the asymptotic behaviour of the m. exceptional zeros, which converge for large n to fixed values.},

The construction of solutions makes use of the theory of cyclic dressing chains of Schr{\"o}dinger operators. Studying the local expansions of the solutions around their singularities we find that some coefficients in their Laurent expansion must vanish, which express precisely the conditions of trivial monodromy of the associated potentials. The characterization of trivial monodromy potentials with quadratic growth implies that all rational solutions can be expressed as Wronskian determinants of suitably chosen sequences of Hermite polynomials. The main classification result states that every rational solution to the A2n-Painlev{\'e} system corresponds to a cycle of Maya diagrams, which can be indexed by an oddly coloured integer sequence. Finally, we establish the link with the standard approach to building rational solutions, based on applying B{\"a}cklund transformations on seed solutions, by providing a representation for the symmetry group action on coloured sequences and Maya cycles.},

From this discovery the modern theory of integrability bloomed, leading scientists to a deep understanding of many nonlinear phenomena which is by no means reachable by perturbation methods or other previous tools from linear theories. Nonlinear phenomena appear everywhere in nature, their description and understanding is therefore of great interest both from the theoretical and applicative point of view. If a nonlinear phenomenon can be represented by an integrable system then we have at our disposal a variety of tools to achieve a better mathematical description of the phenomenon. This special issue is largely dedicated to investigations of nonlinear phenomena which are related to the concept of integrability, either involving integrable systems themselves or because they use techniques from the theory of integrability.},

For N⩾4 Painlev{\'e} analysis indicates that the system should not be integrable, and some periodic and non-periodic trajectories are calculated numerically.

A very successful approach in the study of rational solutions to Painlev{\textbackslash}'e equations involves the reformulation of these scalar equations into a symmetric system of coupled, Riccati-like equations known as dressing chains. Periodic dressing chains are known to be equivalent to the A\_N-Painlev{\textbackslash}'e system, first described by Noumi and Yamada. The Noumi-Yamada system, in turn, can be linearized as using bilinear equations and {$\tau$}-functions; the corresponding rational solutions can then be given as specializations of rational solutions of the KP hierarchy. The classification of rational solutions to Painlev{\textbackslash}'e equations and systems may now be reduced to an analysis of combinatorial objects known as Maya diagrams. The upshot of this analysis is a an explicit determinental representation for rational solutions in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials. In this paper we illustrate this approach by describing Hermite-type rational solutions of Painlev{\textbackslash}'e of the Noumi-Yamada system in terms of cyclic Maya diagrams. By way of example we explicitly construct Hermite-type solutions for the PIV, PV equations and the  A\_4 Painlev{\textbackslash}'e system.},

The algebraic deformations corresponding to the addition of a bound state to a shape-invariant potential are particularly interesting. The polynomial flags in question are indexed by a deformation parameter m = 1, 2, {\dots}, and lead to new algebraically solvable models. We illustrate these ideas by considering deformations of the hyperbolic P{\"o}schl--Teller potential.},

For rational values of this ratio and generic values of the initial data, all orbits are periodic and the system is isochronous. For irrational values of the ratio, there exist periodic and quasi-periodic orbits for different initial data. Moreover, the dependence of the period on the initial data shows a rich behavior and initial data can always be found with arbitrarily large periods.},

  abstract = {We present HADAD (Hexagonal A-Star with Differential Algorithm Designed for weather routing), a novel optimization algorithm for weather routing. HADAD conducts a global exploration using an A  search on a hexagonal grid with higher-order neighbors, enhancing directional flexibility and overcoming limitations of traditional graph searches that constrain vessel movements. It then refines the solution using a discrete Newton--Jacobi variational method, ensuring convergence to a locally optimal, smooth route in continuous space. To evaluate the effectiveness of HADAD, we developed a benchmark comprising 1,560 instances over a full year, varying in origin--destination pairs, vessel speeds and oceanographic conditions. Our results show that HADAD outperforms pure A*  graph search methods by an extra 4\% savings with respect to the shortest-distance route, thanks to more flexible smoother trajectories obtained by gradient descent. In our seasonal study we observe that the savings distribution shows large seasonal variations (double savings on average in winter with respect to summer) and contains a significant number of outliers. Savings reach 27\% in these cases of extreme weather events. Validation of the algorithm performed with synthetic vector fields has been conducted. In this setting, the algorithm has been adapted to handle fuel consumption optimization for Just-in-Time arrival. By integrating global search and local optimization, HADAD effectively balances computational efficiency with route optimality, offering a practical and adaptable solution for real-world weather routing applications.},

Our algorithm is designed to work in both Euclidean and spherical spaces and utilizes a heuristic that allows the vessel to move forward while remaining within a predetermined search cone centered around the destination. This approach not only improves efficiency but also includes obstacle avoidance, making it well-suited for real-world applications.

NILM is often formulated as a classification (ON/OFF) problem for each device. However, the training datasets gathered by smart meters do not contain these labels, but only the electric consumption at every time interval. This paper addresses a fundamental methodological problem in how a NILM problem is posed, namely how the different possible thresholding methods lead to different classification problems. Standard datasets and NILM deep learning models are used to illustrate how the choice of thresholding method affects the output results. Some criteria that should be considered for the choice of such methods are also proposed. Finally, we propose a slight modification to current deep learning models for multi-tasking, i.e. tackling the classification and regression problems simultaneously. Transfer learning between both problems might improve performance on each of them.},

Considering a searcher able to detect such chemical signals and whose motion follows the infotaxis strategy, we study the statistics of the first-passage time to the target when the searcher moves on a finite two-dimensional lattice of different geometries. Far from the target, where the concentration of chemicals is low, the direction of the searcher's first movement is determined by the geometry of the domain and the topology of the lattice, inducing strong fluctuations on the average search time with respect to the initial position of the searcher. The domain is partitioned in well-defined regions characterized by the direction of the first movement. If the search starts over the interface between two different regions, large fluctuations in the search time are observed. {\copyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {In olfactory search an immobile target emits chemical molecules at constant rate. The molecules are transported by the medium, which is assumed to be turbulent. Considering a searcher able to detect such chemical signals and whose motion follows the infotaxis strategy, we study the statistics of the first-passage time to the target when the searcher moves on a finite two-dimensional lattice of different geometries. Far from the target, where the concentration of chemicals is low, the direction of the searcher's first movement is determined by the geometry of the domain and the topology of the lattice, inducing strong fluctuations on the average search time with respect to the initial position of the searcher. The domain is partitioned in well-defined regions characterized by the direction of the first movement. If the search starts over the interface between two different regions, large fluctuations in the search time are observed.},

  abstract = {Infotaxis is an olfactory search strategy proposed in 2007 by Vergassola et al. [M. Vergassola, E. Villermaux, B.I. Shraiman, Nature 445, 406 (2007)], to locate the source of a volatile substance transported in a turbulent environment. We consider a slightly modified strategy that we call blind-infotaxis and study its performance measured by the rate of success and mean search time, under changes in the environmental parameters such as diffusivity, rate of emission or wind velocity. We also quantify the drop in performance caused by an inaccurate modeling of the environment, expressed through an imperfect knowledge of these parameters. Our findings show that without further modification of the probability prior, blind-infotaxis remains robust as long as the estimated parameters fall within a certain range around their true values, but the success rate quickly drops making the search no longer feasible if the searcher severely underestimates or overestimates the real environment parameters. Our results have practical consequences for the design of infotactic machines and for the further optimisation of infotaxis-based strategies.},

NeoCam includes an edge computing device that performs video acquisition and processing in real-time. Compared to other proposed solutions, it has the advantage of handling data more efficiently by performing most of the processing on the device, including proper anonymisation for better compliance with privacy regulations. In addition, it allows to perform various video analysis tasks of clinical interest in parallel at speeds of between 20 and 30 frames-per-second. We introduce algorithms to measure without contact the breathing rate, motor activity, body pose and emotional status of the infants. For breathing rate, our system shows good agreement with existing methods provided there is sufficient light and proper imaging conditions. Models for motor activity and stress detection are new to the best of our knowledge. NeoCam has been tested on preterms in the NICU of the University Hospital Puerta del Mar (C{\'a}diz, Spain), and we report the lessons learned from this trial.},

This meeting was organized under the auspices of the Centre de Recherches Math{\'e}matiques, Universit{\'e} de Montr{\'e}al (Canada).
