Selecting a few relevant features of the predicted probability distribution leads to a multi-objective optimization problem, and the Pareto front contains the most interesting media plans. Using expected return and standard deviation we get the familiar two moment decision model, but other problem specific additional objectives can be incorporated. Factorization Machines, initially introduced for recommendation systems, but later used also for regression, are a good choice for incorporating interaction terms into the model, since they can effectively exploit the sparse nature of typical datasets found in econometrics.},

A stringency index (0--1) was created for each Spanish province ( n=\,50) daily. A hierarchical multiplicative model was fitted. The median of coefficients across provinces (95\% bootstrap confidence intervals) quantified the effect of increasing one standard deviation in the stringency index over the logarithmic return of the weekly percentage variation of the 7-days SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, lagged 12\,days.                Overall, increasing restrictions reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 22\% (RR\,=\,0.78; one-sided 95\%CI: 0, 0.82) in 1 week, with highest effects for culture and leisure 14\% (0.86; 0, 0.98), social distancing 13\% (0.87; 0, 0.95), indoor restaurants 10\% (0.90; 0, 0.95) and indoor sports 6\% (0.94; 0, 0.98). In a reduced model with seven fields, culture and leisure no longer had a significant effect while ceremonies decreased transmission by 5\% (0.95; 0, 0.96).  Increased restrictions decreased COVID-19 transmission. Limitations include remaining collinearity between fields, and somewhat artificial quantification of qualitative restrictions, so the exact attribution of the effect to specific areas must be done with caution.},

Most rely on existing complex DL methods, such as transfer learning or providing the models with carefully designed extracted features based on domain knowledge. A common assumption is that the deeper and more complex the DL model is, the better it learns. In this study, we propose two different DL models for automatic feature extraction from ECG signals for classification tasks: A CNN-LSTM hybrid model and an attention/transformer-based model with wavelet transform for the dimensional embedding. Both of the models extract the features from time series at the initial layers of the neural networks and can obtain performance at least equal to, if not greater than, many contemporary deep neural networks. To validate our hypothesis, we used three publicly available data-sets to evaluate the proposed models. Our model achieved a benchmark accuracy of 99.92\% for fall detection and 99.93\% for the PTB database for myocardial infarction versus normal heartbeat classification.},

  abstract = {Fall is a prominent issue due to its severe consequences both physically and mentally. Fall detection and prevention is a critical area of research because it can help elderly people to depend less on caregivers and allow them to live and move more independently. Using electrocardiograms (ECG) signals independently for fall detection and activity classification is a novel approach used in this paper. An algorithm has been proposed which uses pre-trained convolutional neural networks AlexNet and GoogLeNet as a classifier between the fall and no fall scenarios using electrocardiogram signals. The ECGs for both falling and no falling cases were obtained as part of the study using eight volunteers. The signals are pre-processed using an elliptical filter for signal noises such as baseline wander and power-line interface. As feature extractors, frequency-time representations (scalograms) were obtained by applying a continuous wavelet transform on the filtered ECG signals. These scalograms were used as inputs to the neural network and a significant validation accuracy of 98.08\% was achieved in the first model. The trained model is able to distinguish ECGs with a fall activity from an ECG with a no fall activity with an accuracy of 98.02\%. For the verification of the robustness of the proposed algorithm, our experimental dataset was augmented by adding two different publicly available datasets to it. The second model can classify fall, daily activities and no activities with an accuracy of 98.44\%. These models were developed by transfer learning from the domain of real images to the medical images. In comparison to traditional deep learning approaches, the transfer learning not only avoids ``reinventing the wheel,'' but also presents a lightweight solution to otherwise computationally heavy problems.},

For irrational values, the motions are confined but feature aperiodic motion with sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The system shows a rich dynamical behaviour that can be understood in quantitative detail since a global description of the Riemann surface associated with the solutions can be achieved. The details of the description of the Riemann surface are postponed to a forthcoming publication. This toy model is meant to provide a paradigmatic first step towards understanding a certain novel kind of chaotic behaviour.},

The associated Riemann surface R{$\rightarrow$}C=\{{$\tau$}\} is known to be an infinitely sheeted covering of the complex time plane, ramified at an infinite set of points whose projection in the {$\tau$}-plane is dense. The main novelty of this paper is that the geometrical structure of these infinitely sheeted Riemann surfaces is described in great detail, which allows us to study global properties of the flow such as asymptotic behaviour of the solutions, periodic orbits and their stability or sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The results are then compared with a numerical integration of the equations of motion. Following the recent approach of Calogero, the real time trajectories of the system are given by paths on R that are projected to a circle on the complex plane {$\tau$}. Due to the branching of R, the solutions may have different periods or may be aperiodic.},

Studying the local expansions of the solutions around their singularities we find that some coefficients in their Laurent expansion must vanish, which express precisely the conditions of trivial monodromy of the associated potentials. The characterization of trivial monodromy potentials with quadratic growth implies that all rational solutions can be expressed as Wronskian determinants of suitably chosen sequences of Hermite polynomials. The main classification result states that every rational solution to the A2n-Painlev{\'e} system corresponds to a cycle of Maya diagrams, which can be indexed by an oddly coloured integer sequence.

Nonlinear phenomena appear everywhere in nature, their description and understanding is therefore of great interest both from the theoretical and applicative point of view. If a nonlinear phenomenon can be represented by an integrable system then we have at our disposal a variety of tools to achieve a better mathematical description of the phenomenon.

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss a family of toy models for many-body interactions including velocity-dependent forces. By generalizing a construction due to Calogero, we obtain a class of N-body problems in the plane which have periodic orbits for a large class of initial conditions. The two- and three-body cases (N=2, 3) are exactly solvable, with all solutions being periodic, and we present their explicit solutions. For N⩾4 Painlev{\'e} analysis indicates that the system should not be integrable, and some periodic and non-periodic trajectories are calculated numerically. The construction can be generalized to a broad class of systems, and the mechanism which describes the transition to orbits with higher periods, and eventually to aperiodic or even chaotic orbits, could be present in more realistic models with a mixed phase space. This scenario is different from the onset of chaos by a sequence of Hopf bifurcations.},

Unlike the classical families, these new examples, called exceptional orthogonal polynomials, feature non-standard polynomial flags; the lowest degree polynomial has degree m{$>$}0. In this paper we review the classification of codimension m=1 exceptional polynomials, and give a novel, compact proof of the fundamental classification theorem for codimension 1 polynomial flags. As well, we describe the mechanism or rational factorizations of 2nd order operators as the analogue of the Darboux transformation in this context. We finish with the example of higher codimension generalization of Jacobi polynomials and perform the complete analysis of parameter values for which these families have non-singular weights.},

A very successful approach in the study of rational solutions to Painlev{\textbackslash}'e equations involves the reformulation of these scalar equations into a symmetric system of coupled, Riccati-like equations known as dressing chains. Periodic dressing chains are known to be equivalent to the A\_N-Painlev{\textbackslash}'e system, first described by Noumi and Yamada. The Noumi-Yamada system, in turn, can be linearized as using bilinear equations and {$\tau$}-functions; the corresponding rational solutions can then be given as specializations of rational solutions of the KP hierarchy. The classification of rational solutions to Painlev{\textbackslash}'e equations and systems may now be reduced to an analysis of combinatorial objects known as Maya diagrams. The upshot of this analysis is a an explicit determinental representation for rational solutions in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials. In this paper we illustrate this approach by describing Hermite-type rational solutions of Painlev{\textbackslash}'e of the Noumi-Yamada system in terms of cyclic Maya diagrams. By way of example we explicitly construct Hermite-type solutions for the PIV, PV equations and the  A\_4 Painlev{\textbackslash}'e system.},

For rational values of this ratio and generic values of the initial data, all orbits are periodic and the system is isochronous. For irrational values of the ratio, there exist periodic and quasi-periodic orbits for different initial data.

HADAD conducts a global exploration using an A  search on a hexagonal grid with higher-order neighbors, enhancing directional flexibility and overcoming limitations of traditional graph searches that constrain vessel movements. It then refines the solution using a discrete Newton--Jacobi variational method, ensuring convergence to a locally optimal, smooth route in continuous space. To evaluate the effectiveness of HADAD, we developed a benchmark comprising 1,560 instances over a full year, varying in origin--destination pairs, vessel speeds and oceanographic conditions. Our results show that HADAD outperforms pure A*  graph search methods by an extra 4\% savings with respect to the shortest-distance route, thanks to more flexible smoother trajectories obtained by gradient descent. In our seasonal study we observe that the savings distribution shows large seasonal variations (double savings on average in winter with respect to summer) and contains a significant number of outliers. Savings reach 27\% in these cases of extreme weather events. Validation of the algorithm performed with synthetic vector fields has been conducted. In this setting, the algorithm has been adapted to handle fuel consumption optimization for Just-in-Time arrival. By integrating global search and local optimization, HADAD effectively balances computational efficiency with route optimality, offering a practical and adaptable solution for real-world weather routing applications.},

Our algorithm is designed to work in both Euclidean and spherical spaces and utilizes a heuristic that allows the vessel to move forward while remaining within a predetermined search cone centered around the destination. This approach not only improves efficiency but also includes obstacle avoidance, making it well-suited for real-world applications.

NILM is often formulated as a classification (ON/OFF) problem for each device. However, the training datasets gathered by smart meters do not contain these labels, but only the electric consumption at every time interval. This paper addresses a fundamental methodological problem in how a NILM problem is posed, namely how the different possible thresholding methods lead to different classification problems. Standard datasets and NILM deep learning models are used to illustrate how the choice of thresholding method affects the output results. Some criteria that should be considered for the choice of such methods are also proposed. Finally, we propose a slight modification to current deep learning models for multi-tasking, i.e. tackling the classification and regression problems simultaneously. Transfer learning between both problems might improve performance on each of them.},

This information has potential for gaining insight into tuna behaviour and abundance, but has traditionally been difficult to process and use. The current study combines FAD logbook data, oceanographic data and echo-sounder buoy data to evaluate different Machine Learning models and establish a pipeline, named TUN-AI, for processing echo-sounder buoy data and estimating tuna biomass (in metric tons, t) at various levels of complexity: binary classification, ternary classification and regression. Models were trained and tested on over 5000 sets and over 6000 deployments. Of all the models evaluated, the best performing one uses a 3-day window of echo-sounder data, oceanographic data and position/time derived features. This model is able to estimate if tuna biomass was higher than 10\,t or lower than 10\,t with an F1-score  of 0.925. When directly estimating tuna biomass, the best model (Gradient Boosting) has an error (MAE) of 21.6\,t and a relative error (SMAPE) of 29.5\%, when evaluated over sets. All models tested improved when enriched with oceanographic and position-derived features, highlighting the importance of these features when using echo-sounder buoy data. Potential applications of this methodology, and future improvements, are discussed.},

Considering a searcher able to detect such chemical signals and whose motion follows the infotaxis strategy, we study the statistics of the first-passage time to the target when the searcher moves on a finite two-dimensional lattice of different geometries. Far from the target, where the concentration of chemicals is low, the direction of the searcher's first movement is determined by the geometry of the domain and the topology of the lattice, inducing strong fluctuations on the average search time with respect to the initial position of the searcher. The domain is partitioned in well-defined regions characterized by the direction of the first movement. If the search starts over the interface between two different regions, large fluctuations in the search time are observed.},

We consider a slightly modified strategy that we call blind-infotaxis and study its performance measured by the rate of success and mean search time, under changes in the environmental parameters such as diffusivity, rate of emission or wind velocity. We also quantify the drop in performance caused by an inaccurate modeling of the environment, expressed through an imperfect knowledge of these parameters. Our findings show that without further modification of the probability prior, blind-infotaxis remains robust as long as the estimated parameters fall within a certain range around their true values, but the success rate quickly drops making the search no longer feasible if the searcher severely underestimates or overestimates the real environment parameters. Our results have practical consequences for the design of infotactic machines and for the further optimisation of infotaxis-based strategies.},

Furthermore, the right (resp. left) tail of the distribution seems to follow a power-law with exponent {$\alpha\approx$}4.60 (resp. {$\alpha\approx$}4.28).

  abstract = {The Workshop on Group Theory and Numerical Analysis brought together scientists working in several different but related areas. The unifying theme was the application of group theory and geometrical methods to the solution of differential and difference equations. The emphasis was on the combination of analytical and numerical methods and also the use of symbolic computation. This meeting was organized under the auspices of the Centre de Recherches Math{\'e}matiques, Universit{\'e} de Montr{\'e}al (Canada). This volume has the character of a monograph and should represent a useful reference book for scientists working in this highly topical field.},
