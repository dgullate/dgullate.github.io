abstract: A new family of A N-type Dunkl operators preserving a polynomial subspace
  of finite dimension is constructed. Using a general quadratic combination of these
  operators and the usual Dunkl operators, several new families of exactly and quasi-exactly
  solvable quantum spin Calogero-Sutherland models are obtained. These include, in
  particular, three families of quasi-exactly solvable elliptic spin Hamiltonians.
