abstract: Exceptional orthogonal polynomials are complete families of orthogonal polynomials
  that arise as eigenfunctions of a Sturm--Liouville problem. Antonio Durán discovered
  a gap in the original proof of completeness for exceptional Hermite polynomials,
  that has propagated to analogous results for other exceptional families. In this
  paper we provide an alternative proof that follows essentially the same arguments,
  but provides a direct proof of the key lemma on which the completeness proof is
  based. This direct proof makes use of the theory of trivial monodromy potentials
  developed by Duistermaat and Grünbaum and Oblomkov.
