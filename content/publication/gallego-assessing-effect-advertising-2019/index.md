abstract: Abstract             We propose a robust implementation of the Nerlove-Arrow
  model using a Bayesian structural time series model to explain the relationship
  between advertising expenditures of a countrywide fast-food franchise network with
  its weekly sales. Due to the flexibility and modularity of the model, it is well
  suited to generalization to other markets or situations. Its Bayesian nature facilitates
  incorporating a priori information reflecting the manager's views, which can be
  updated with relevant data. This aspect of the model will be used to support the
  decision of the manager on the budget scheduling of the advertising firm across
  time and channels.
