abstract: A generalization of the procedures for constructing quasi-exactly solvable
  models with one degree of freedom to (quasi-)exactly solvable models of N particles
  on a line allows deriving many well-known models in the framework of a new approach
  that does not use root systems. In particular, a BC N elliptic Calogero--Sutherland
  model is found among the quasi-exactly solvable models. For certain values of the
  paramaters of this model, we can explicitly calculate the ground state and the lowest
  excitations.
