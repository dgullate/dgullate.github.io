abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is generally framed as a supervised
  learning problem whose input is the time series for aggregated power load of a household
  and whose output is the time series for the consumption of an individual appliance.
  Often the interest lies in predicting whether an appliance is ON or OFF, rather
  than its power usage. In this paper we propose a modification of a state-of-the-art
  convolutional neural network architecture to allow for multi-output channels, solving
  the regression and classification problems with relative weights simultaneously.
  We analyze the performance of this multi-output model and study the interplay between
  the two approaches on NILM.
