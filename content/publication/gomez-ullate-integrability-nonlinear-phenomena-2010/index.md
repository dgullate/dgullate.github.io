abstract: Back in 1967, Clifford Gardner, John Greene, Martin Kruskal and Robert Miura
  published a seminal paper in Physical Review Letters which was to become a cornerstone
  in the theory of integrable systems.  From this discovery the modern theory of integrability
  bloomed, leading scientists to a deep understanding of many nonlinear phenomena
  which is by no means reachable by perturbation methods or other previous tools from
  linear theories. Nonlinear phenomena appear everywhere in nature, their description
  and understanding is therefore of great interest both from the theoretical and applicative
  point of view. If a nonlinear phenomenon can be represented by an integrable system
  then we have at our disposal a variety of tools to achieve a better mathematical
  description of the phenomenon. This special issue is largely dedicated to investigations
  of nonlinear phenomena which are related to the concept of integrability, either
  involving integrable systems themselves or because they use techniques from the
  theory of integrability.
