abstract: We construct several new families of exactly and quasi-exactly solvable
  BCN -type CalogeroSutherland models with internal degrees of freedom. Our approach
  is based on the introduction of a new family of Dunkl operators of BN type which,
  together with the original BN -type Dunkl operators, are shown to preserve certain
  polynomial subspaces of finite dimension. We prove that a wide class of quadratic
  combinations involving these three sets of Dunkl operators always yields a spin
  Calogero--Sutherland model, which is (quasi-)exactly solvable by construction. We
  show that all the spin Calogero--Sutherland models obtainable within this framework
  can be expressed in a unified way in terms of a Weierstrass $℘$ function with suitable
  half-periods. This provides a natural spin counterpart of the well-known general
  formula for a scalar completely integrable potential of BCN type due to Olshanetsky
  and Perelomov. As an illustration of our method, we exactly compute several energy
  levels and their corresponding wavefunctions of an elliptic quasi-exactly solvable
  potential for two and three particles of spin 1/2
