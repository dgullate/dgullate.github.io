abstract: In this paper we discuss a family of toy models for many-body interactions
  including velocity-dependent forces. By generalizing a construction due to Calogero,
  we obtain a class of N-body problems in the plane which have periodic orbits for
  a large class of initial conditions. The two- and three-body cases (N=2, 3) are
  exactly solvable, with all solutions being periodic, and we present their explicit
  solutions. For N⩾4 Painlevé analysis indicates that the system should not be integrable,
  and some periodic and non-periodic trajectories are calculated numerically. The
  construction can be generalized to a broad class of systems, and the mechanism which
  describes the transition to orbits with higher periods, and eventually to aperiodic
  or even chaotic orbits, could be present in more realistic models with a mixed phase
  space. This scenario is different from the onset of chaos by a sequence of Hopf
  bifurcations.
