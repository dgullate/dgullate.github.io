 abstract = {We prove that every rational extension of the quantum harmonic oscillator that is exactly solvable by polynomials is monodromy free, and therefore can be obtained by applying a finite number of state-deleting Darboux transformations on the harmonic oscillator. Equivalently, every exceptional orthogonal polynomial system of Hermite type can be obtained by applying a Darboux-Crum transformation to the classical Hermite polynomials. Exceptional Hermite polynomial systems only exist for even codimension 2 m, and they are indexed by the partitions $łambda$ of m. We provide explicit expressions for their corresponding orthogonality weights and differential operators and a separate proof of their completeness. Exceptional Hermite polynomials satisfy a 2$\ell$ + 3 recurrence relation where $\ell$ is the length of the partition $łambda$. Explicit expressions for such recurrence relations are given. o̧pyright 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
