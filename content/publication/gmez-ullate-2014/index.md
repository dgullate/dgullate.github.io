abstract: We prove that every rational extension of the quantum harmonic oscillator
  that is exactly solvable by polynomials is monodromy free, and therefore can be
  obtained by applying a finite number of state-deleting Darboux transformations on
  the harmonic oscillator. Equivalently, every exceptional orthogonal polynomial system
  of Hermite type can be obtained by applying a Darboux-Crum transformation to the
  classical Hermite polynomials. Exceptional Hermite polynomial systems only exist
  for even codimension 2 m, and they are indexed by the partitions $łambda$ of m.
  We provide explicit expressions for their corresponding orthogonality weights and
  differential operators and a separate proof of their completeness. Exceptional Hermite
  polynomials satisfy a 2$ell$ + 3 recurrence relation where $ell$ is the length of
  the partition $łambda$. Explicit expressions for such recurrence relations are given.
