abstract: A new class of many-body models is identified and investigated. Just as
  those we recently discovered, these many-body problems are solvable provided the
  initial data satisfy certain constraints; for such data the solution of the initial-value
  problem can be achieved via algebraic operations, such as finding the zeros of known
  polynomials. Entirely isochronous subclasses of these models are also exhibited,
  whose generic solutions are completely periodic with the same fixed period in their
  entire phase space. o̧pyright 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.
