abstract: 36% of global tropical tuna catch relies on dFADs -- drifting fish aggregating
  devices used by tuna purse seine fleets across all major oceans. These dFADs are
  equipped with high tech echosounder buoys that remotely provide information on tuna
  abundance and location. Spanish researchers have developed Tun-Al, an AI tool that
  processes information from these buoys to improve knowledge on tuna ecology. Tun-AI
  combines dFAD echosounder buoy data, remote-sensing data, and catch statistics for
  uniquely accurate biomass predictions. The project represents a unique collaboration
  between researchers, the fishing industry, and the technology sector in favour of
  scientific research.
