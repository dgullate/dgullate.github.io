 abstract = {36% of global tropical tuna catch relies on dFADs -- drifting fish aggregating devices used by tuna purse seine fleets across all major oceans. These dFADs are equipped with high tech echosounder buoys that remotely provide information on tuna abundance and location. Spanish researchers have developed Tun-Al, an AI tool that processes information from these buoys to improve knowledge on tuna ecology. Tun-AI combines dFAD echosounder buoy data, remote-sensing data, and catch statistics for uniquely accurate biomass predictions. The project represents a unique collaboration between researchers, the fishing industry, and the technology sector in favour of scientific research.},
