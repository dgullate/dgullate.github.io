abstract: Although the solutions of Painlevé equations are transcendental in the sense
  that they cannot be expressed in terms of known elementary functions, there do exist
  rational solutions for specialized values of the equation parameters. A very successful
  approach in the study of rational solutions to Painlev ́equations involves the reformulation
  of these scalar equations into a symmetric system of coupled, Riccati-like equations
  known as dressing chains. Periodic dressing chains are known to be equivalent to
  the A_N-Painlev'śystem, first described by Noumi and Yamada. The Noumi-Yamada system,
  in turn, can be linearized as using bilinear equations and $τ$-functions; the corresponding
  rational solutions can then be given as specializations of rational solutions of
  the KP hierarchy. The classification of rational solutions to Painlev'eq́uations
  and systems may now be reduced to an analysis of combinatorial objects known as
  Maya diagrams. The upshot of this analysis is a an explicit determinental representation
  for rational solutions in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials. In this paper
  we illustrate this approach by describing Hermite-type rational solutions of Painlev'e  ́the
  Noumi-Yamada system in terms of cyclic Maya diagrams. By way of example we explicitly
  construct Hermite-type solutions for the PIV, PV equations and the  A_4 Painlev'e
  st́em.
