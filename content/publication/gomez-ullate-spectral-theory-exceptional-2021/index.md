abstract: In this paper we revisit exceptional Hermite polynomials from the point
  of view of spectral theory, following the work initiated by Lance Littlejohn. Adapting
  a result of Deift, we provide an alternative proof of the completeness of these
  polynomial families. In addition, using equivalence of Hermite Wronskians we characterize
  the possible gap sets for the class of exceptional Hermite polynomials.
