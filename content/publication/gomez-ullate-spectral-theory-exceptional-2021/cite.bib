 abstract = {In this paper we revisit exceptional Hermite polynomials from the point of view of spectral theory, following the work initiated by Lance Littlejohn. Adapting a result of Deift, we provide an alternative proof of the completeness of these polynomial families. In addition, using equivalence of Hermite Wronskians we characterize the possible gap sets for the class of exceptional Hermite polynomials.},
