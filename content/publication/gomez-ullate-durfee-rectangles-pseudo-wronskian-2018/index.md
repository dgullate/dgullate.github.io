abstract: Abstract             We derive identities between determinants whose entries
  are Hermite polynomials. These identities have a combinatorial interpretation in
  terms of Maya diagrams, partitions and Durfee rectangles, and serve to characterize
  an equivalence class of rational Darboux transformations. Since the determinants
  have different orders, we analyze the problem of finding the minimal order determinant
  in each equivalence class, and describe the solution using an elegant graphical
  interpretation. The results are applied to provide a more efficient representation
  for exceptional Hermite polynomials and for rational solutions of the Painlevé IV
  equation. The latter are expressed in terms of the Okamoto and generalized Hermite
  polynomials.
