abstract: In this paper we perform a statistical analysis of the high-frequency returns
  of the Ibex35 Madrid stock exchange index. We find that its probability distribution
  seems to be stable over different time scales, a stylized fact observed in many
  different financial time series. However, an in-depth analysis of the data using
  maximum likelihood estimation and different goodness-of-fit tests rejects the Lévy-stable
  law as a plausible underlying probabilistic model. The analysis shows that the Normal
  Inverse Gaussian distribution provides an overall fit for the data better than any
  of the other subclasses of the family of Generalized Hyperbolic distributions and
  certainly much better than the Lévy-stable laws. Furthermore, the right (resp. left)
  tail of the distribution seems to follow a power-law with exponent $α≈$4.60 (resp.
  $α≈$4.28). Finally, we present evidence that the observed stability is due to temporal
  correlations or non-stationarities of the data.
