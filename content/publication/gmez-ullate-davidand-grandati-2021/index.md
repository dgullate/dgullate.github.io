abstract: This note presents the classification of ladder operators corresponding
  to the class of rational extensions of the harmonic oscillator. We show that it
  is natural to endow the class of rational extensions and the corresponding intertwining
  operators with the structure of a category $ℝ피핏핋$. The combinatorial data for this
  interpretation is realized as a functor $필픻ℝ피핏핋$, where $필픻$refers to the set of
  Maya diagrams appropriately endowed with categorical structure. Our formalism allows
  us to easily reproduce and extend earlier results on ladder operators.
