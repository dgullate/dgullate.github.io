 abstract = {This note presents the classification of ladder operators corresponding to the class of rational extensions of the harmonic oscillator. We show that it is natural to endow the class of rational extensions and the corresponding intertwining operators with the structure of a category $ℝ피핏핋$. The combinatorial data for this interpretation is realized as a functor $필픻ℝ피핏핋$, where $필픻$refers to the set of Maya diagrams appropriately endowed with categorical structure. Our formalism allows us to easily reproduce and extend earlier results on ladder operators.},
