abstract: We provide a full classification scheme for exceptional Jacobi operators
  and polynomials. The classification contains six degeneracy classes according to
  whether $$α$,$β$$ or $$αbackslash$pm$β$$ assume integer values. Exceptional Jacobi
  operators are in one-to-one correspondence with spectral diagrams, a combinatorial
  object that describes the number and asymptotic behaviour at the endpoints of $(-1,1)$
  of all quasi-rational eigenfunctions of the operator. With a convenient indexing
  scheme for spectral diagrams, explicit Wronskian and integral construction formulas
  are given to build the exceptional operators and polynomials from the information
  encoded in the spectral diagram. In the fully degenerate class $$α$,$βbackslash$inmathbb
  N_0$ there exist exceptional Jacobi operators with an arbitrary number of continuous
  parameters. The classification result is achieved by a careful description of all
  possible rational Darboux transformations that can be performed on exceptional Jacobi
  operators.
