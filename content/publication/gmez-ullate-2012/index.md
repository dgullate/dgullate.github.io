abstract: We provide an example of how the complex dynamics of a recently introduced
  model can be understood via a detailed analysis of its associated Riemann surface.
  Thanks to this geometric description an explicit formula for the period of the orbits
  can be derived, which is shown to depend on the initial data and the continued fraction
  expansion of a simple ratio of the coupling constants of the problem. For rational
  values of this ratio and generic values of the initial data, all orbits are periodic
  and the system is isochronous. For irrational values of the ratio, there exist periodic
  and quasi-periodic orbits for different initial data. Moreover, the dependence of
  the period on the initial data shows a rich behavior and initial data can always
  be found with arbitrarily large periods. o̧pyright 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights
