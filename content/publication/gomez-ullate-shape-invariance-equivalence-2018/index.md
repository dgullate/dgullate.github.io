abstract: In a previous paper we derived equivalence relations for pseudo-Wronskian
  determinants of Hermite polynomials. In this paper we obtain the analogous result
  for Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. The equivalence formulas are richer in this
  case since rational Darboux transformations can be defined for four families of
  seed functions, as opposed to only two families in the Hermite case. The pseudo-Wronskian
  determinants of Laguerre and Jacobi type will thus depend on two Maya diagrams,
  while Hermite pseudo-Wronskians depend on just one Maya diagram. We show that these
  equivalence relations can be interpreted as the general transcription of shape invariance
  and specific discrete symmetries acting on the parameters of the isotonic oscillator
  and Darboux-P ̈oschl-Teller potential.
