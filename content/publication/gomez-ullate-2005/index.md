abstract: Calogero's goldfish N-body problem describes the motion of N point particles
  subject to mutual interaction with velocity-dependent forces under the action of
  a constant magnetic field transverse to the plane of motion. When all coupling constants
  are equal to one, the model has the property that for generic initial data, all
  motions of the system are periodic. In this paper we investigate which are the possible
  periods of the system for fixed N , and we show that there exist initial data that
  realize each of these possible periods. We then discuss the asymptotic behaviour
  of the maximal period for large particle number N .
