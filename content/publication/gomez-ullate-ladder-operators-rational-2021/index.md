abstract: This note presents the classification of ladder operators corresponding
  to the class of rational extensions of the harmonic oscillator. We show that it
  is natural to endow the class of rational extensions and the corresponding intertwining
  operators with the structure of a category REXT. The combinatorial data for this
  interpretation is realized as a functor  MD -$>$ REXT, where MD  refers to the set
  of Maya diagrams appropriately endowed with categorical structure. Our formalism
  allows us to easily reproduce and extend earlier results on ladder operators.
