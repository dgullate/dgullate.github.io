abstract: We adapt the notion of the Darboux transformation to the context of polynomial
  Sturm-Liouville problems. As an application, we characterize the recently described
  Xm Laguerre polynomials in terms of an isospectral Darboux transformation. We also
  show that the shape invariance of these new polynomial families is a direct consequence
  of the permutability property of the Darboux-Crum transformation. o̧pyright 2010
