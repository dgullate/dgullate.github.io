abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is the problem of predicting the status
  or consumption of individual domestic appliances only from the knowledge of the
  aggregated power load. NILM is often formulated as a classification (ON/OFF) problem
  for each device. However, the training datasets gathered by smart meters do not
  contain these labels, but only the electric consumption at every time interval.
  This paper addresses a fundamental methodological problem in how a NILM problem
  is posed, namely how the different possible thresholding methods lead to different
  classification problems. Standard datasets and NILM deep learning models are used
  to illustrate how the choice of thresholding method affects the output results.
  Some criteria that should be considered for the choice of such methods are also
  proposed. Finally, we propose a slight modification to current deep learning models
  for multi-tasking, i.e. tackling the classification and regression problems simultaneously.
  Transfer learning between both problems might improve performance on each of them.
