abstract: This paper is part of a program that aims to understand the connection between
  the emergence of chaotic behaviour in dynamical systems in relation with the multi-valuedness
  of the solutions as functions of complex time $τ$. In this work we consider a family
  of systems whose solutions can be expressed as the inversion of a single hyperelliptic
  integral. The associated Riemann surface R $i̊ghtarrow$ C = $τ$ is known to be an
  infinitely sheeted covering of the complex time plane, ramified at an infinite set
  of points whose projection in the $τ$-plane is dense. The main novelty of this paper
  is that the geometrical structure of these infinitely sheeted Riemann surfaces is
  described in great detail, which allows us to study global properties of the flow
  such as asymptotic behaviour of the solutions, periodic orbits and their stability
  or sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The results are then compared with
  a numerical integration of the equations of motion. Following the recent approach
  of Calogero, the real time trajectories of the system are given by paths on R that
  are projected to a circle on the complex plane $τ$. Due to the branching of R, the
  solutions may have different periods or may be aperiodic. o̧pyright 2007 Elsevier
