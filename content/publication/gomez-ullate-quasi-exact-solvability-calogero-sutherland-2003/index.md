abstract: We introduce a new family of Dunkl operators preserving a polynomial subspace
  of finite dimension. Several new quantum Calogero--Sutherland models are then obtained
  by generalizing the methods of one-dimensional QES theory. These models describe
  many particles with or without spin moving in one spatial dimension. A complete
  classification has been performed, which shows the first examples of models with
  elliptic interaction for which some eigenvalues can be calculated in an explicit
  way.
