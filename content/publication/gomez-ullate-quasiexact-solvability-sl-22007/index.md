abstract: 'We present evidence to suggest that the study of one-dimensional quasi-exactly
  solvable (QES) models in quantum mechanics should be extended beyond the usual sl(2)
  approach. The motivation is twofold: We first show that certain quasi-exactly solvable
  potentials constructed with the sl(2) Liealgebraic method allow for a new larger
  portion of the spectrum to be obtained algebraically. This is done via another algebraization
  in which the algebraic Hamiltonian cannot be expressed as a polynomial in the generators
  of sl(2). We then show an example of a new quasi-exactly solvable potential which
  cannot be obtained within the Lie algebraic approach.'
