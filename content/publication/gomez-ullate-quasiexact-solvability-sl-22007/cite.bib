 abstract = {We present evidence to suggest that the study of one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable (QES) models in quantum mechanics should be extended beyond the usual sl(2) approach. The motivation is twofold: We first show that certain quasi-exactly solvable potentials constructed with the sl(2) Liealgebraic method allow for a new larger portion of the spectrum to be obtained algebraically. This is done via another algebraization in which the algebraic Hamiltonian cannot be expressed as a polynomial in the generators of sl(2). We then show an example of a new quasi-exactly solvable potential which cannot be obtained within the Lie algebraic approach.},
