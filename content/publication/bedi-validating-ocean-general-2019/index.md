abstract: 'Drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (dFADs) are small drifting platforms
  with an attached solar powered buoy that report their position with daily frequency
  via GPS. We use data of 9,440 drifting objects provided by a buoys manufacturing
  company, to test the predictions of surface current velocity provided by two of
  the main models: the NEMO model used by Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring
  Service (CMEMS) and the HYCOM model used by the Global Ocean Forecast System (GOFS).'
