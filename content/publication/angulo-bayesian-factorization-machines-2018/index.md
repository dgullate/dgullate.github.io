abstract: When considering different allocations of the marketing budget of a firm,
  some predictions, that correspond to scenarios similar to others observed in the
  past, can be made with more confidence than others, that correspond to more innovative
  strategies. Selecting a few relevant features of the predicted probability distribution
  leads to a multi-objective optimization problem, and the Pareto front contains the
  most interesting media plans. Using expected return and standard deviation we get
  the familiar two moment decision model, but other problem specific additional objectives
  can be incorporated. Factorization Machines, initially introduced for recommendation
  systems, but later used also for regression, are a good choice for incorporating
  interaction terms into the model, since they can effectively exploit the sparse
  nature of typical datasets found in econometrics.
