abstract: In this paper we will try to assess the multifractality displayed by the
  high-frequency returns of Madrid's Stock Exchange Ibex35 index. A Multifractal Detrended
  Fluctuation Analysis shows that this index has a wide singularity spectrum which
  is most likely caused by its long-memory. Our findings also show that this long-memory
  can be considered as the superposition of a high-frequency component-related to
  the daily cycles of arrival of information to the market-over a slowly-varying component
  that reverberates for long periods of time and which shows no apparent relation
  with human/economic cycles. This latter component is therefore postulated to be
  endogenous to market's dynamics and to be also the most probable source of some
  of the stylized facts commonly associated with financial time-series.
