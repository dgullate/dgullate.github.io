abstract: 'We estimated the association between the level of restriction in nine different
  fields of activity and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in Spain, from 15 September 2020
  to 9 May 2021.              A stringency index (0--1) was created for each Spanish
  province ( n=,50) daily. A hierarchical multiplicative model was fitted. The median
  of coefficients across provinces (95% bootstrap confidence intervals) quantified
  the effect of increasing one standard deviation in the stringency index over the
  logarithmic return of the weekly percentage variation of the 7-days SARS-CoV-2 cumulative
  incidence, lagged 12,days.                Overall, increasing restrictions reduced
  SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 22% (RR,=,0.78; one-sided 95%CI: 0, 0.82) in 1 week,
  with highest effects for culture and leisure 14% (0.86; 0, 0.98), social distancing
  13% (0.87; 0, 0.95), indoor restaurants 10% (0.90; 0, 0.95) and indoor sports 6%
  (0.94; 0, 0.98). In a reduced model with seven fields, culture and leisure no longer
  had a significant effect while ceremonies decreased transmission by 5% (0.95; 0,
  0.96).  Increased restrictions decreased COVID-19 transmission. Limitations include
  remaining collinearity between fields, and somewhat artificial quantification of
  qualitative restrictions, so the exact attribution of the effect to specific areas
  must be done with caution.'
