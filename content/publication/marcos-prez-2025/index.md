abstract: In recent years, the production of LNG and LPG ships has increased, driven
  by the increasing demand for natural and petroleum gases. To meet this demand, ship
  designs must be optimized at all stages, requiring designers to have advanced, efficient
  and accurate design tools. This study presents new statistical and regression analyses
  of data extracted from the Hyundai Heavy Industries Shipbuilding Group catalogue
  which includes information on LNG and LPG ships built between 1979 and 2023. The
  database includes 145 LNG carriers and 322 LPG carriers, representing approximately
