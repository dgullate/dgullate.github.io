 abstract = {In recent years, the production of LNG and LPG ships has increased, driven by the increasing demand for natural and petroleum gases. To meet this demand, ship designs must be optimized at all stages, requiring designers to have advanced, efficient and accurate design tools. This study presents new statistical and regression analyses of data extracted from the Hyundai Heavy Industries Shipbuilding Group catalogue which includes information on LNG and LPG ships built between 1979 and 2023. The database includes 145 LNG carriers and 322 LPG carriers, representing approximately 20},
