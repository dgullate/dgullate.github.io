abstract: In olfactory search an immobile target emits chemical molecules at constant
  rate. The molecules are transported by the medium, which is assumed to be turbulent.
  Considering a searcher able to detect such chemical signals and whose motion follows
  the infotaxis strategy, we study the statistics of the first-passage time to the
  target when the searcher moves on a finite two-dimensional lattice of different
  geometries. Far from the target, where the concentration of chemicals is low, the
  direction of the searcher's first movement is determined by the geometry of the
  domain and the topology of the lattice, inducing strong fluctuations on the average
  search time with respect to the initial position of the searcher. The domain is
  partitioned in well-defined regions characterized by the direction of the first
  movement. If the search starts over the interface between two different regions,
  large fluctuations in the search time are observed.
