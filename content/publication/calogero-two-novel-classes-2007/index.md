abstract: Two novel classes of many-body models with nonlinear interactions `of goldfish
  type' are introduced. They are solvable provided the initial data satisfy a single
  constraint (in one case; in the other, two constraints), i.e., for such initial
  data the solution of their initial-value problem can be achieved via algebraic operations,
  such as finding the eigenvalues of given matrices or equivalently the zeros of known
  polynomials. Entirely isochronous versions of some of these models are also exhibited,
  i.e., versions of these models whose nonsingular solutions are all completely periodic
  with the same period.
