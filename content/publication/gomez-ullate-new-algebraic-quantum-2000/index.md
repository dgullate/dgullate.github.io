abstract: We develop a systematic procedure for constructing quantum many-body problems
  whose spectrum can be partially or totally computed by purely algebraic means. The
  exactly-solvable models include rational and hyperbolic potentials related to root
  systems, in some cases with an additional external field. The quasiexactly solvable
  models can be considered as deformations of the previous ones which share their
  algebraic character.
