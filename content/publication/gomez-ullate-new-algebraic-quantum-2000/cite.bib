 abstract = {We develop a systematic procedure for constructing quantum many-body problems whose spectrum can be partially or totally computed by purely algebraic means. The exactly-solvable models include rational and hyperbolic potentials related to root systems, in some cases with an additional external field. The quasiexactly solvable models can be considered as deformations of the previous ones which share their algebraic character.},
