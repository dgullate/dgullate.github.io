abstract: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called the Hybrid Search algorithm
  to tackle the Zermelo's navigation problem. This method can be regarded as an extension
  of the recent Ferraro--Martín de Diego-Sato algorithm to allow for further exploration
  in search for the global optimum, in situations of complex vector fields where many
  locally optimal trajectories exist. Our algorithm is designed to work in both Euclidean
  and spherical spaces and utilizes a heuristic that allows the vessel to move forward
  while remaining within a predetermined search cone centered around the destination.
  This approach not only improves efficiency but also includes obstacle avoidance,
  making it well-suited for real-world applications. We evaluate the performance of
  the Hybrid Search algorithm on synthetic vector fields and real ocean currents,
  demonstrating its effectiveness and performance.
