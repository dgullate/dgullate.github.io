abstract: The Lie point symmetries of a coupled system of two nonlinear differential-difference
  equations are investigated. It is shown that in special cases the symmetry group
  can be infinite dimensional, in other cases up to ten dimensional. The equations
  can describe the interaction of two long molecular chains, each involving one type
  of atoms.
