abstract: This paper focuses on the construction of rational solutions for the  A_2n-Painlevé
  system, also called the Noumi-Yamada system, which are considered the higher order
  generalizations of PIV Painlevé. In this even case, we introduce a method to construct
  the rational solutions based on cyclic dressing chains of Schrödinger operators
  with potentials in the class of rational extensions of the harmonic oscillator.
  Each potential in the chain can be indexed by a single Maya diagram and expressed
  in terms of a Wronskian determinant whose entries are Hermite polynomials. We introduce
  the notion of cyclic Maya diagrams and characterize them for any possible period,
  using the concepts of genus and interlacing. The resulting classes of solutions
  can be expressed in terms of special polynomials that generalize the families of
  generalized Hermite, generalized Okamoto, and Umemura polynomials, showing that
  they are particular cases of a larger~family.
