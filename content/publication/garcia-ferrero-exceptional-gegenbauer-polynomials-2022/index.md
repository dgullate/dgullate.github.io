abstract: In this paper, we show how to construct exceptional orthogonal polynomials
  (XOP) using isospectral deformations of classical orthogonal polynomials. The construction
  is based on confluent Darboux transformations, where repeated factorizations at
  the same eigenvalue are allowed. These factorizations allow us to construct Sturm--Liouville
  problems with polynomial eigenfunctions that have an arbitrary number of real-valued
  parameters. We illustrate this new construction by exhibiting the class of deformed
  Gegenbauer polynomials, which are XOP families that are isospectral deformations
  of classical Gegenbauer polynomials.
