abstract: 'Exceptional orthogonal polynomial systems (X-OPSs) arise as eigenfunctions
  of Sturm-Liouville problems, but without the assumption that an eigenpolynomial
  of every degree is present. In this sense, they generalize the classical families
  of Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi, and include as a special case the family of CPRS
  orthogonal polynomials introduced by Cariñena et al. (J. Phys. A 41:085301, 2008).
  We formulate the following conjecture: every exceptional orthogonal polynomial system
  is related to a classical system by a Darboux-Crum transformation. We give a proof
  of this conjecture for codimension 2 exceptional orthogonal polynomials (X2-OPs).
  As a by-product of this analysis, we prove a Bochner-type theorem classifying all
  possible X2-OPSs. The classification includes all cases known to date plus some
  new examples of X2-Laguerre and X2-Jacobi polynomials. o̧pyright 2012 SFoCM.'
