abstract: "This special issue of the Journal of Nonlinear Mathematical Physics collects
  papers related to the 17th NEEDS (Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Dynamical Systems)
  meeting, held from 15th to 24th June 2007 in L'Ametlla de Mar, Spain. The papers
  gathered here are refereed contributions from researchers in the field of integrable
  equations and dynamical systems on topics related to the main themes of the NEEDS
  meeting. As in previous editions, the workshop had an interdisciplinary character
  with emphasis on the following: $∙$ Integrable and chaotic dynamical systems $∙$
  Analytic, algebraic and geometric aspects of integrable systems $∙$ Mathematical
  methods in quantum mechanics: exact solutions, spectral problems $∙$ Nonlinear phenomena
  and applications: waves, solitons, pattern formation"
