 abstract = {This special issue of the Journal of Nonlinear Mathematical Physics collects papers related to the 17th NEEDS (Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Dynamical Systems) meeting, held from 15th to 24th June 2007 in L'Ametlla de Mar, Spain. The papers gathered here are refereed contributions from researchers in the field of integrable equations and dynamical systems on topics related to the main themes of the NEEDS meeting. As in previous editions, the workshop had an interdisciplinary character with emphasis on the following: $∙$ Integrable and chaotic dynamical systems $∙$ Analytic, algebraic and geometric aspects of integrable systems $∙$ Mathematical methods in quantum mechanics: exact solutions, spectral problems $∙$ Nonlinear phenomena and applications: waves, solitons, pattern formation},
