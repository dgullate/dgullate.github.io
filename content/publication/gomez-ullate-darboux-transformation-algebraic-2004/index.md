abstract: We investigate the backward Darboux transformations (addition of the lowest
  bound state) of shape-invariant potentials on the line, and classify the subclass
  of algebraic deformations, those for which the potential and the bound states are
  simple elementary functions. A countable family, m = 0, 1, 2, dots, of deformations
  exists for each family of shape-invariant potentials. We prove that the mth deformation
  is exactly solvable by polynomials, meaning that it leaves invariant an infinite
  flag of polynomial modules , where  is a codimension m subspace of $łangle$1, z,
  dots, zn$ångle$. In particular, we prove that the first (m = 1) algebraic deformation
  of the shape-invariant class is precisely the class of operators preserving the
  infinite flag of exceptional monomial modules . By construction, these algebraically
  deformed Hamiltonians do not have an  hidden symmetry algebra structure.
