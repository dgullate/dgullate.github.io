abstract: 'We propose a more direct approach to constructing differential operators
  that preserve polynomial subspaces than the one based on considering elements of
  the enveloping algebra of . This approach is used here to construct new exactly
  solvable and quasi-exactly solvable quantum Hamiltonians on the line which are not
  Lie-algebraic. It is also applied to generate potentials with multiple algebraic
  sectors. We discuss two illustrative examples of these two applications: we show
  that the generalized Lamé potential possesses four algebraic sectors, and describe
  a quasi-exactly solvable deformation of the Morse potential which is not Lie-algebraic.'
