 abstract = {We propose a more direct approach to constructing differential operators that preserve polynomial subspaces than the one based on considering elements of the enveloping algebra of . This approach is used here to construct new exactly solvable and quasi-exactly solvable quantum Hamiltonians on the line which are not Lie-algebraic. It is also applied to generate potentials with multiple algebraic sectors. We discuss two illustrative examples of these two applications: we show that the generalized Lamé potential possesses four algebraic sectors, and describe a quasi-exactly solvable deformation of the Morse potential which is not Lie-algebraic.},
