 abstract = {The Workshop on Group Theory and Numerical Analysis brought together scientists working in several different but related areas. The unifying theme was the application of group theory and geometrical methods to the solution of differential and difference equations. The emphasis was on the combination of analytical and numerical methods and also the use of symbolic computation. This meeting was organized under the auspices of the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques, Université de Montréal (Canada). This volume has the character of a monograph and should represent a useful reference book for scientists working in this highly topical field.},
