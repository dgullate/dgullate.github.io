abstract: The Workshop on Group Theory and Numerical Analysis brought together scientists
  working in several different but related areas. The unifying theme was the application
  of group theory and geometrical methods to the solution of differential and difference
  equations. The emphasis was on the combination of analytical and numerical methods
  and also the use of symbolic computation. This meeting was organized under the auspices
  of the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques, Université de Montréal (Canada). This
  volume has the character of a monograph and should represent a useful reference
  book for scientists working in this highly topical field.
