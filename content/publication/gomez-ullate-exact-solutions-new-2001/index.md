abstract: A quantum Hamiltonian describing N particles on a line interacting pairwise
  via an elliptic function potential in the presence of an external field is introduced.
  For a discrete set of values of the strength of the external potential, it is shown
  that a finite number of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the model can be exactly
  computed in an algebraic way.
