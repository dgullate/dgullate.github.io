 abstract = {A quantum Hamiltonian describing N particles on a line interacting pairwise via an elliptic function potential in the presence of an external field is introduced. For a discrete set of values of the strength of the external potential, it is shown that a finite number of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the model can be exactly computed in an algebraic way.},
