abstract: In this paper we derive structure theorems which characterize the spaces
  of linear and non-linear differential operators that preserve finite dimensional
  subspaces generated by polynomials in one or several variables. By means of the
  useful concept of deficiency, we can write an explicit basis for these spaces of
  differential operators. In the case of linear operators, these results apply to
  the theory of quasi-exact solvability in quantum mechanics, especially in the multivariate
  case where the Lie algebraic approach is harder to apply. In the case of non-linear
  operators, the structure theorems in this paper can be applied to the method of
  finding special solutions of non-linear evolution equations by nonlinear separation
  of variables.
