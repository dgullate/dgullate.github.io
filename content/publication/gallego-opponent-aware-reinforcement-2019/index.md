abstract: We introduce Threatened Markov Decision Processes (TMDPs) as an extension
  of the classical Markov Decision Process framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL).
  TMDPs allow suporting a decision maker against potential opponents in a RL context.
  We also propose a level-k thinking scheme resulting in a novel learning approach
  to deal with TMDPs. After introducing our framework and deriving theoretical results,
  relevant empirical evidence is given via extensive experiments, showing the benefits
  of accounting for adversaries in RL while the agent learns
