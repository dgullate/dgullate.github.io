abstract: Exceptional orthogonal polynomials are families of orthogonal polynomials
  that arise as solutions of Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems. They generalize
  the classical families of Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials by allowing
  for polynomial sequences that miss a finite number of ''exceptional'' degrees. In
  this paper we introduce a new construction of multi-parameter exceptional Legendre
  polynomials by considering the isospectral deformation of the classical Legendre
  operator. Using confluent Darboux transformations and a technique from inverse scattering
  theory, we obtain a fully explicit description of the operators and polynomials
  in question. The main novelty of the paper is the novel construction that allows
  for exceptional polynomial families with an arbitrary number of real parameters.
