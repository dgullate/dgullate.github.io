 abstract = {Considering successive extensions of primary translationally shape invariant potentials, we enlarge the Krein-Adler theorem to mixed chains of state adding and state-deleting Darboux-BÃ¤cklund transformations. It allows us to establish novel bilinear Wronskian and determinantal identities for classical orthogonal polynomials.},
