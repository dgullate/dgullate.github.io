abstract: Considering successive extensions of primary translationally shape invariant
  potentials, we enlarge the Krein-Adler theorem to mixed chains of state adding and
  state-deleting Darboux-BÃ¤cklund transformations. It allows us to establish novel
  bilinear Wronskian and determinantal identities for classical orthogonal polynomials.
