abstract: These are the lecture notes for a course on exceptional polynomials taught
  at the AIMS-Volkswagen Stiftung Workshop on Introduction to Orthogonal Polynomials
  and Applications that took place in Douala (Cameroon) from October 5--12, 2018.
  They summarize the basic results and construction of exceptional poynomials, developed
  over the past 10 years. In addition, some new results are presented on the construction
  of rational solutions to Painlevé equation PIV and its higher order generalizations
  that belong to the A2n(1)-Painlevé hierarchy. The construction is based on dressing
  chains of Schrödinger operators with potentials that are rational extensions of
  the harmonic oscillator. Some of the material presented here (Sturm-Liouville operators,
  classical orthogonal polynomials, Darboux-Crum transformations, etc.) are classical
  and can be found in many textbooks, while some results (genus, interlacing and cyclic
  Maya diagrams) are new and presented for the first time in this set of lecture notes.
