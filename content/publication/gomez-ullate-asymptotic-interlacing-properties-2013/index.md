abstract: 'In this paper we state and prove some properties of the zeros of exceptional
  Jacobi and Laguerre polynomials. Generically, the zeros of exceptional polynomials
  fall into two classes: the regular zeros, which lie in the interval of orthogonality
  and the exceptional zeros, which lie outside that interval. We show that the regular
  zeros have two interlacing properties: one is the natural interlacing between zeros
  of consecutive polynomials as a consequence of their Sturm-Liouville character,
  while the other one shows interlacing between the zeros of exceptional and classical
  polynomials. A Heine-Mehler type formula is provided for the exceptional polynomials,
  which allows to derive the asymptotic behaviour of their regular zeros for large
  degree n and fixed codimension m. We also describe the location and the asymptotic
  behaviour of the m. exceptional zeros, which converge for large n to fixed values.'
