abstract: It was recently conjectured that every system of exceptional orthogonal
  polynomials is related to a classical orthogonal polynomial system by a sequence
  of Darboux transformations. In this paper we prove this conjecture, which paves
  the road to a complete classification of all exceptional orthogonal polynomials.
  In some sense, this paper can be regarded as the extension of Bochner's result for
  classical orthogonal polynomials to the exceptional class. As a supplementary result,
  we derive a canonical form for exceptional operators based on a bilinear formalism,
  and prove that every exceptional operator has trivial monodromy at all primary poles.
