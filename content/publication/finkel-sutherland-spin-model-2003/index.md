abstract: The B_N hyperbolic Sutherland spin model is expressed in terms of a suitable
  set of commuting Dunkl operators. This fact is exploited to derive a complete family
  of commuting integrals of motion of the model, thus establishing its integrability.
  The Dunkl operators are shown to possess a common flag of invariant finite-dimensional
  linear spaces of smooth scalar functions. This implies that the Hamiltonian of the
  model preserves a corresponding flag of smooth spin functions. The discrete spectrum
  of the restriction of the Hamiltonian to this spin flag is explicitly computed by
  triangularization. The integrability of the hyperbolic Sutherland spin chain of
  B N type associated with the dynamical model is proved using Polychronakos's ``freezing
  trick''.
