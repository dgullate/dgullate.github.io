abstract: 'We introduce and discuss a simple Hamiltonian dynamical system, interpretable
  as a three-body problem in the (complex) plane and providing the prototype of a
  mechanism explaining the transition from regular to irregular motions as travel
  on Riemann surfaces. The interest of this phenomenology---illustrating the onset
  in a deterministic context of irregular motions---is underlined by its generality,
  suggesting its eventual relevance to understand natural phenomena and experimental
  investigations. Here only some of our main findings are reported, without detailing
  their proofs: a more complete presentation will be published elsewhere.'
