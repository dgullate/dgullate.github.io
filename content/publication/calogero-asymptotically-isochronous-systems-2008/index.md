abstract: "Mechanisms are elucidated underlying the existence of dynamical systems
  whose generic solutions approach asymptotically (at large time) isochronous evolutions:
  all their dependent variables tend asymptotically to functions periodic with the
  same fixed period. We focus on two such mechanisms, emphasizing their generality
  and illustrating each of them via a representative example. The first example belongs
  to a recently discovered class of integrable indeed solvable many-body problems.
  The second example consists of a broad class of (generally nonintegrable) models
  obtained by deforming appropriately the well-known (integrable and isochronous)
  many-body problem with inverse-cube two-body forces and a one-body linear (``harmonic
  oscillator'') force."
