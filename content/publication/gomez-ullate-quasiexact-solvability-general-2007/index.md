abstract: Our goal in this paper is to extend the theory of quasi-exactly solvable
  Schrödinger operators beyond the Lie-algebraic class. Let  be the space of nth degree
  polynomials in one variable. We first analyze exceptional polynomial subspaces ,
  which are those proper subspaces of  invariant under second-order differential operators
  which do not preserve . We characterize the only possible exceptional subspaces
  of codimension one and we describe the space of second-order differential operators
  that leave these subspaces invariant. We then use equivalence under changes of variable
  and gauge transformations to achieve a complete classification of these new, non-Lie
  algebraic Schrödinger operators. As an example, we discuss a finite gap elliptic
  potential which does not belong to the Treibich--Verdier class.
