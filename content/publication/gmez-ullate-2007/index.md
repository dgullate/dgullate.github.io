abstract: In this paper we derive structure theorems which characterize the spaces
  of linear and non-linear differential operators that preserve finite dimensional
  subspaces generated by polynomials in one or several variables. By means of the
  useful concept of deficiency, we can write an explicit basis for these spaces of
  differential operators. In the case of linear operators, these results apply to
  the theory of quasi-exact solvability in quantum mechanics, especially in the multivariate
  case where the Lie algebraic approach is harder to apply. In the case of non-linear
  operators, the structure theorems in this paper can be applied to the method of
  finding special solutions of non-linear evolution equations by nonlinear separation
  of variables. 1. Introduction. It is a fact that the Schrödinger operators whose
  point spectrum , or at least part of it, can be computed algebraically are often
  related to differential operators admitting invariant spaces of polynomials. Lie
  algebras have played a unifying role in this area, because many of these polynomial
  spaces turn out to be irreducible modules for a faithful representation of a finite-dimensional
  Lie algebra by means of first-order differential operators. The classical theory
  of quasi-exactly solvable potentials has thus been built on the assumption that
  the exactly solvable Schrödinger operator under study should be expressible as a
  quadratic element in the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie
  algebra of first-order differential operators, admitting an explicitly computable
  invariant sub-space of square-integrable functions, or a complete infinite flag
  thereof [1, 2, 3, 4].
