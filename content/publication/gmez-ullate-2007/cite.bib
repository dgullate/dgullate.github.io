 abstract = {In this paper we derive structure theorems which characterize the spaces of linear and non-linear differential operators that preserve finite dimensional subspaces generated by polynomials in one or several variables. By means of the useful concept of deficiency, we can write an explicit basis for these spaces of differential operators. In the case of linear operators, these results apply to the theory of quasi-exact solvability in quantum mechanics, especially in the multivariate case where the Lie algebraic approach is harder to apply. In the case of non-linear operators, the structure theorems in this paper can be applied to the method of finding special solutions of non-linear evolution equations by nonlinear separation of variables. 1. Introduction. It is a fact that the Schrödinger operators whose point spectrum , or at least part of it, can be computed algebraically are often related to differential operators admitting invariant spaces of polynomials. Lie algebras have played a unifying role in this area, because many of these polynomial spaces turn out to be irreducible modules for a faithful representation of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra by means of first-order differential operators. The classical theory of quasi-exactly solvable potentials has thus been built on the assumption that the exactly solvable Schrödinger operator under study should be expressible as a quadratic element in the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of first-order differential operators, admitting an explicitly computable invariant sub-space of square-integrable functions, or a complete infinite flag thereof [1, 2, 3, 4].},
