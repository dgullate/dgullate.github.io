 abstract = {It has been recently discovered that exceptional families of Sturm-Liouville orthogonal polynomials exist, that generalize in some sense the classical polynomials of Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi. In this paper we show how new families of exceptional orthogonal polynomials can be constructed by means of multiple-step algebraic Darboux transformations. The construction is illustrated with an example of a 2-step Darboux transformation of the classical Laguerre polynomials, which gives rise to a new orthogonal polynomial system indexed by two integer parameters. For particular values of these parameters, the classical Laguerre and the type II X$\ell$-Laguerre polynomials are recovered. o̧pyright 2011 Elsevier Inc.},
