abstract: It has been recently discovered that exceptional families of Sturm-Liouville
  orthogonal polynomials exist, that generalize in some sense the classical polynomials
  of Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi. In this paper we show how new families of exceptional
  orthogonal polynomials can be constructed by means of multiple-step algebraic Darboux
  transformations. The construction is illustrated with an example of a 2-step Darboux
  transformation of the classical Laguerre polynomials, which gives rise to a new
  orthogonal polynomial system indexed by two integer parameters. For particular values
  of these parameters, the classical Laguerre and the type II X$ell$-Laguerre polynomials
  are recovered. o̧pyright 2011 Elsevier Inc.
