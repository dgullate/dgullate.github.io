abstract: We provide a complete classification and an explicit representation of rational
  solutions to the fourth Painlevé equation PIV and its higher order generalizations
  known as the A2n-Painlevé or Noumi-Yamada systems. The construction of solutions
  makes use of the theory of cyclic dressing chains of Schrödinger operators. Studying
  the local expansions of the solutions around their singularities we find that some
  coefficients in their Laurent expansion must vanish, which express precisely the
  conditions of trivial monodromy of the associated potentials. The characterization
  of trivial monodromy potentials with quadratic growth implies that all rational
  solutions can be expressed as Wronskian determinants of suitably chosen sequences
  of Hermite polynomials. The main classification result states that every rational
  solution to the A2n-Painlevé system corresponds to a cycle of Maya diagrams, which
  can be indexed by an oddly coloured integer sequence. Finally, we establish the
  link with the standard approach to building rational solutions, based on applying
  Bäcklund transformations on seed solutions, by providing a representation for the
  symmetry group action on coloured sequences and Maya cycles.
