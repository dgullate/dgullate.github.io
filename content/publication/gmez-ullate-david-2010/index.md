abstract: We prove an extension of Bochner's classical result that characterizes the
  classical polynomial families as eigenfunctions of a second-order differential operator
  with polynomial coefficients. The extended result involves considering differential
  operators with rational coefficients and the requirement is that they have a numerable
  sequence of polynomial eigenfunctions p1,p2,...of all degrees except for degree
  zero. The main theorem of the paper provides a characterization of all such differential
  operators. The existence of such differential operators and polynomial sequences
  is based on the concept of exceptional polynomial subspaces, and the converse part
  of the main theorem rests on the classification of codimension one exceptional subspaces
  under projective transformations, which is performed in this paper. o̧pyright 2009
