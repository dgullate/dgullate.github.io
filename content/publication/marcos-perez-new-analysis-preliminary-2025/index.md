abstract: In recent years, the production of LNG and LPG ships has increased, driven
  by the increasing demand for natural and petroleum gases. To meet this demand, ship
  designs must be optimized at all stages, requiring designers to have advanced, efficient
  and accurate design tools. This study presents new statistical and regression analyses
  of data extracted from the Hyundai Heavy Industries Shipbuilding Group catalogue
  which includes information on LNG and LPG ships built between 1979 and 2023. The
  database includes 145 LNG carriers and 322 LPG carriers, representing approximately
  20% of the global gas carrier fleet. Simple and multiple regression analyses were
  used to estimate dependent variables and their correlation to other ship parameters.
  In addition, Machine Learning algorithms were trained and compared against these
  traditional methods. This study provides updated tools to support the preliminary
  design of LNG and LPG ships, enhancing the understanding and accuracy of early-stage
  design decisions.
