abstract: The work of Adler provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the Wronskian
  of a given sequence of eigenfunctions of Schrödinger's equation to have constant
  sign in its domain of definition. We extend this result by giving explicit formulas
  for the number of real zeros of the Wronskian of an arbitrary sequence of eigenfunctions.
  Our results apply in particular to Wronskians of classical orthogonal polynomials,
  thus generalizing classical results by Karlin and Szegő. Our formulas hold under
  very mild conditions that are believed to hold for generic values of the parameters.
  In the Hermite case, our results allow to prove some conjectures recently formulated
  by Felder et al.
