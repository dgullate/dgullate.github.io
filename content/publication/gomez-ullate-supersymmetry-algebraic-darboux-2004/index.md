abstract: We describe a class of algebraically solvable SUSY models by considering
  the deformation of invariant polynomial flags by means of the Darboux transformation.
  The algebraic deformations corresponding to the addition of a bound state to a shape-invariant
  potential are particularly interesting. The polynomial flags in question are indexed
  by a deformation parameter m = 1, 2, dots, and lead to new algebraically solvable
  models. We illustrate these ideas by considering deformations of the hyperbolic
  Pöschl--Teller potential.
