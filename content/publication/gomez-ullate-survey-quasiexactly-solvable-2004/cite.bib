 abstract = {We present a brief survey of quasi-exactly solvable systems andCalogero--Sutherland models. We describe a general method, based on thesimultaneous use of multiple families of Dunkl operators, yielding several newfamilies of quasi-exactly solvable Calogero--Sutherland models with spin.},
