abstract: We present a brief survey of quasi-exactly solvable systems andCalogero--Sutherland
  models. We describe a general method, based on thesimultaneous use of multiple families
  of Dunkl operators, yielding several newfamilies of quasi-exactly solvable Calogero--Sutherland
  models with spin.
