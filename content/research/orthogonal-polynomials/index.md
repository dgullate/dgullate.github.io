This research project focuses on the study and development of orthogonal polynomials, which are a class of polynomials that satisfy specific orthogonality conditions with respect to a given weight function over a certain interval. Orthogonal polynomials have significant applications in various fields such as numerical analysis, physics, and engineering.
